        Interpreter VS Compiler
        (A) Interpreter ->
        1. Interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code.
        2. Interpreter is needed every time.
        3. Partial execution if any error in the code.
        4. Easy for programmers.

        (B) Compiler ->
        1. The Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code.
        2. Once code gets compiled, the compiler is not needed.
        3. Code will not get executed if there is any error.
        4. Usually not as easy as Interpreted ones.
