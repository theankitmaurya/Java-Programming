//        Object-Oriented Programming ->
//        Class -> A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
//        Objects -> An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined a template (info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.
//        How to model a problem in OOPS -> We identify the following:
//        Noun -> class -> Employee
//        Adjective -> Attributes -> name, age, salary
//        Verb -> Methods -> getSalary(), increment()
