        (1) - Java is a hybrid language -> both compiled and interpreted
        (2) - A JVM can be used to interpret this bytecode
        (3) - This bytecode can be taken to any platform for execution
        (4) - Hance, Java is platform independent

        Executing a JAVA Program ->
        javac Main.java -> compiled
        java Main -> interpreted

        So far, IntelliJ IDEA is managing the execution of our program.
